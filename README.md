Bootstrap school assignment

In this assignment I followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_9u1P5YjVc&list=RDCMUCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg&index=1

I did not follow the last 2 steps but I do now understand what Bootstrap is and how it can help in designing a website.
(The Sass I did not use, it says 0,4% because it is part of the last 2 steps from the tutorial that I didn't take, only started).

I used everything in the website from Bootstrap - icons also.

I found it very helpful and made the website alot more functional than I've ever achieved before. I will definitely use it later on.
